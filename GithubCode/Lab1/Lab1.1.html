		Pets and the Pandemic
		A report from <b>Animal Medicines Australia (AMA)</b> has found that many Australians took the opportunity to introduce a pet into their household during the pandemic. 
		Their survey indicated that there was a significant <b>increase</b> in the percent of households taking in a new dog, fish or bird. 
		Their research also indicated that pets had a <br>number of positive <i>influences</i> on their lives such as:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>companionship</li>
		<li>better mental health</li>
		<li>joy and happiness.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers to 
    consider the needs of companion animals <br>and their owners when considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are well as 
    accepting animals in public places and transport.</p>
